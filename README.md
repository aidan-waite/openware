# Adding a minigame
1. Install Unity 2019.4.12f1 LTS
2. Open project
3. Create a new folder in Minigames
4. Put your scene and all related files in your new folder
5. Use a minigame-specific namespace for all of your scripts
6. Open the MainMenu scene and add a button for your new minigame. You can duplicate one of the existing buttons and change the text and string in the ChangeScene component
7. Update readme with the source of any art or sound assets used
8. Make a pull request with your new minigame

# Art and sound assets
Art and sound assets can only be used if we've got the appropriate license. For this reason, making original art is encouraged. If you source art or sound from somewhere please link it here after you check that the license permits its use. Note "original" here means it was created specifically for Openware and thus it uses Openware's license.
